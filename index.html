        # Bibliometric-enhanced Exploratory search systems for education of ocean and climate sciences

        ## the context:
          - Canadian secondary and university educators
          - marginalized communities
          - coastal impacts of climate change

        ## the problem
          ### part 1:
            - the need to mitigate citation accumulation bias
            - citations as proxies for other things, not just similarity
            - citation-based decisions vs citation influences on behaviour

          ### part 2:
            - typical IR systems use both citation and popularity ranking
            - List-based results encourage web behaviour : satisficing
            - Our current discovery/IR systems are contributing to citation bias

        ## the goal
          - an ESS that aims to mitigate citation bias, connects disjointed education literature with ocean and climate literature relevant to their immediate community
